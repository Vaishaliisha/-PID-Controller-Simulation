# 🎯 PID Controller Simulation — Control Meets Python 🎛️🐍

Welcome to my simulation of a **PID Controller** in Python!  
This project helps visualize how a **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)** controller stabilizes and corrects the behavior of a dynamic system.

> 💡 This is where math meets engineering — making systems smarter and more stable.

## ⚙️ What is a PID Controller?

A **PID controller** is used in **control systems** to reach and maintain a desired output (setpoint). It continuously calculates the error between the setpoint and current value, and adjusts the control input accordingly.

**PID = Proportional + Integral + Derivative**

- 📏 **Proportional (P):** Reacts to current error  
- 🧮 **Integral (I):** Reacts to accumulated error over time  
- 🌀 **Derivative (D):** Reacts to the rate of change of error
